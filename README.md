# SQL-Data-Exploration-of-COVID-19-Pandemic

For my COVID-19 data exploration project, I used SQL to analyze and extract insights from a dataset containing COVID-19 data. I utilized various SQL queries and commands to retrieve, filter, aggregate, and analyze the data, revealing meaningful patterns and trends. By leveraging SQL's powerful capabilities for data manipulation and analysis, I was able to gain valuable insights into the impact of the pandemic, identify patterns in the spread of the virus, and uncover key statistics related to COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries.
